Other basic operations provided by Redis are [DEL](#help) to delete a given key and associated value,
[INCR](#help) to atomically increment a number stored at a given key:

<pre><code>
    <a href="#run">SET connections 10</a>
    <a href="#run">INCR connections</a> => 11
    <a href="#run">INCR connections</a> => 12
    <a href="#run">DEL connections</a>
    <a href="#run">INCR connections<a/> => 1
</code></pre>

It is also possible to increment the number contained inside a key by a specific amount:

<pre><code>
    <a href="#run">INCRBY connections 100</a> => 101
</code></pre>

And there are similar commands in order to decrement the value of the key.

<pre><code>
    <a href="#run">DECR connections</a> => 100
    <a href="#run">DECRBY connections 10</a> => 90
</code></pre>

When you manipulate Redis strings with incrementing and decrementing commands, you are
implementing _counters_. Counters are a very popular application for Redis.
