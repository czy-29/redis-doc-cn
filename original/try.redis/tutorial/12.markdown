Sets also have a command very similar to [LPOP](#help) and [RPOP](#help)
in order to extract elements from the set and return them to the client
in a single operation. However since sets are not ordered data structures
the returned (and removed) elements are totally casual in this case.

<pre></code>
    <a href="#run">SADD letters a b c d e f</a> => 6
    <a href="#run">SPOP letters 2</a> => 1) "c" 2) "a"
</code></pre>

The argument of [SPOP](#help) after the name of the key, is the number
of elements we want it to return, and remove from the set.

Now the set will have just the remaining elements:

<pre></code>
    <a href="#run">SMEMBERS letters</a> => 1) "b" 2) "d" 3) "e" 4) "f"
</code></pre>

There is also a command to return random elements without removing such
elements from the set, it is called [SRANDMEMBER](#help). You can try it
yourself, the arguments are similar to [SPOP](#help), but if you specify
a negative count instead of a positive one, it may also return repeating
elements.
