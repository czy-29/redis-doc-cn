[LRANGE](#help) gives a subset of the list. It takes the index of the first element
you want to retrieve as its first parameter and the index of the last element
you want to retrieve as its second parameter. A value of -1 for the second
parameter means to retrieve elements until the end of the list, -2 means to
include up to the penultimate, and so forth.
