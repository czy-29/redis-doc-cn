Redis is in the family of databases called key-value stores.

The essence of a key-value store is the ability to store some data,
called a value, inside a key. This data can later be retrieved only if we know
the exact key used to store it.

Often Redis it is called a data structure server because it has outer key-value shell, but each
value can contain a complex data structure, such as a string, a list, a hashes, or ordered data
structures called sorted sets as well as probabilistic data structures like hyperloglog.

As a first example, we can use the command [SET](#help) to store the value "fido" at key "server:name":

<pre><code>
    <a href="#run">SET server:name "fido"</a>
</code></pre>

Redis will store our data permanently, so we can later ask "What is the value
stored at key server:name?" and Redis will reply with "fido":

<pre><code>
    <a href="#run">GET server:name</a> => "fido"
</code></pre>

There is a command in order to test if a give key exists or not:

<pre><code>
    <a href="#run">EXISTS server:name</a> => 1
    <a href="#run">EXISTS server:blabla</a> => 0
</code></pre>
