So far we explored the commands that let you add elements to the list,
and [LRANGE](#help) that let you inspect ranges of the list. A fundamental
functionality of Redis lists is the ability to remove, and return to the
client at the same time, elements in the head or the tail of the list.

[LPOP](#help) removes the first element from the list and returns it.

<pre><code>
    <a href="#run">LPOP friends</a> => "Sam"
</code></pre>

[RPOP](#help) removes the last element from the list and returns it.

<pre><code>
    <a href="#run">RPOP friends</a> => "Bob"
</code></pre>

Note that the list now only has one element:

<pre><code>
    <a href="#run">LLEN friends</a> => 1
    <a href="#run">LRANGE friends 0 -1</a> => 1) "Alice"
</code></pre>
