Commercial Support
---

[Redis Labs](https://redislabs.com) is the official sponsor of open source Redis.

In addition, Redis Labs provides commercial Redis support with Redis Enterprise, available as [a fully-managed cloud service](https://redislabs.com/products/redis-cloud/) and an [on-premises software deployment](https://redislabs.com/redis-enterprise/advantages).

Redis Enterprise simplifies the management of Redis at scale and includes [advanced security](https://redislabs.com/enterprise-grade-redis-security/), [active-active geo distribution](https://redislabs.com/redis-enterprise/technology/active-active-geo-distribution/), and on-call customer support.

Redis Labs also develops several Redis modules that extend the functionality of Redis. These include [RediSearch](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisearch/) (querying, indexing, and full-text search for Redis), [RedisJSON](https://oss.redislabs.com/redisjson/) (JSON for Redis), and [RedisTimeSeries](https://oss.redislabs.com/redistimeseries/) (a time series database on Redis).
